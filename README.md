# Programming-Massively-Parallel-Processors-A-Handson-Approach

- Code reference: [Code reference](https://github.com/nvixnu/pmpp__programming_massively_parallel_processors/tree/master)
- Install opencv c++: [Install opencv c++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-opencv-in-c-on-linux/)
- Compile cuda code with opencv: [opencv + cuda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38185331/how-to-include-and-use-opencv3-1-0-library-to-cuda-file-cu/52929300#52929300)
- You should copy /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2 to /usr/local/include:
  - sudo cp -r /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2 /usr/local/include
- Note: with opencv:
  - image.cols is number of column (width of image).
  - image.rows is number of row (height of image).
